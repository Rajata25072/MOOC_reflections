When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	- 1) To be able to collaborate with others
	2) Back-up file on the cloud
	3) Work solo, but with >1 computer
	4) Show the code to others as portfolio

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	- 1) Know when ready to pull and not causing any harm to curretly ongoing local work
	2) Pull when significant logical change has been made on remote
